# CoAP_example
A simple CoAP example in Java, demonstrating how to generate and parse packet

This is not a complete protocol but an example as a tutorial to show how packets are generated and parsed.
File(hardcoded as d:/packet.txt) is used as a bus to facilitate without understanding of socket communication.
Callback is simplified by flag in thread.
